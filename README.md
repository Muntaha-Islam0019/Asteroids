# Asteroids
According to Wikipedia, Asteroids is a space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade game designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh and released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. The player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers.

This project is basically the remake of Asteroids; rather a simplified edition. Unfortunately, it's still being developed. Though, you can still fly around with the ~~Millennium Falcon~~ Ship. Thank you for visiting here!
